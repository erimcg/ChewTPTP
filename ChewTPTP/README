INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING CHEWTPTP AND SUPPORTING SOFTWARE
------------------------------------------------------------

The following programs are not included in the chewtptp install archive but
are needed to compile chewtptp and its supporting software.

 	+ g++-4.2 or greater
	+ autoconf
	+ automake
	+ m4 
	+ lex
	+ bison

The following instructions assume chewtptp.tar.gz was untarred in $INSTALL_DIR.
Make the appropriate substitutions in the instructions below.

After untarring, the following files should be in $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp:
	
	+ bin
	+ gmp-4.2.2
	+ src
	+ yices-1.0.13-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz
	+ yices-1.0.13-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz


1.  	Install GMP (GNU Multiprecision Library) which is required to run Yices.
	To install, execute the following commands.  Look out for errors,
	especially when running 'make check'. The libraries are written to 
	$INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/gmp-4.2.2/.libs. 
	(Note the 's' on the end of directory name '.libs')

	$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp
	$ tar -xzvf gmp-4.2.2.tar.gz 
	$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/gmp-4.2.2
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check 	<= VERY IMPORTANT!!!

2.	Untar the appropriate version of Yices (http://yices.csl.sri.com) depending
	on your system architecture.

	$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp
	$ tar -xzvf yices-1.0.13-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz 
		or
	$ tar -xzvf yices-1.0.13-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz 
	
3.	Add the directores $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/gmp-4.2.2/.libs and 
	$INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/yices-1.0.13/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental 
	variable in your shell script file.  Don't forget to reload the shell script file 
	to make the variable visible in you environment.
	
	E.g. add 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/gmp-4.2.2/.libs:$INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/yices-1.0.13/lib' 
	to .bashrc.

4.	Compile the chewtptp theorem prover

	$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/src
	$ make

5.	Test that chewtptp is executable.  

	$ cd $INSTALL_DIR/chewtptp/bin
	$ ./chewtptp

	If you see the message "SZS status InputError: too few arguments" you have
	succeeded in installing our theorem prover.  If not, please feel free to email me
	at mcgregre@clarkson.edu.
